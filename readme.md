## What the project is about 
The project is designed to securely manage and verify vaccination records through a decentralized platform. It utilizes blockchain technology to create verifiable claims related to vaccination information, which are then stored and managed using a combination of IPFS for data storage and Ethereum smart contracts for data integrity and verification.

## Why we are doing it
The initiative aims to address issues related to the traditional management of vaccination records, such as data fragmentation, lack of trust, and accessibility challenges. By leveraging blockchain, the project ensures that vaccination records are immutable, secure, and easily verifiable, thereby improving trust and interoperability across different healthcare systems and stakeholders.

## How to do part it
 Implementing the project involves several key technologies and steps, such as using web3.js to interact with Ethereum blockchain, Solidity for smart contracts, and IPFS API for data storage. Key processes include creating DID documents, uploading them to IPFS, binding them with user wallet addresses in smart contracts, and developing a secure method for issuing and verifying vaccination verifiable claims.

## Who is the solution intended for 
The solution is intended for a wide range of stakeholders within the healthcare ecosystem, including individuals who wish to manage and verify their vaccination status, healthcare providers, vaccination companies, and government or regulatory bodies that require reliable and secure access to vaccination records.

## When should the solution be used
The solution should be used whenever there is a need to securely manage, share, or verify vaccination information. This includes situations such as international travel, school enrollments, access to public events, or any scenario where proof of vaccination is required.

## Where should the solution be used
it can be used globally across different countries and healthcare systems.
