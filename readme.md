**What the Project is About**

This project aims to develop a decentralized identity verification and verifiable credentials system (VeriChainID) based on blockchain technology. 

**Why We Are Doing It**

With the advent of the digital age, there is an increasing need for a secure, reliable, and convenient method of identity verification for individuals and institutions. Traditional identity verification systems, relying on centralized management, are prone to data breaches and identity theft. This project offers a decentralized approach, giving users full control over their identity data, thereby improving security and privacy protection.

**How to Do Part It**

The project integrates blockchain technology, proxy re-encryption, and smart contracts to achieve decentralized identity authentication and data management. Users can create and manage their digital identities (DIDs) on the platform and generate verifiable credentials (VCs), which third parties can verify under user authorization without direct access to sensitive information.

**Who Is the Solution Intended For**

The solution targets individuals and institutions requiring digital identity verification, including but not limited to financial services, educational certifications, healthcare, and government services.

**When Should the Solution Be Used**

The solution is applicable in any scenario requiring secure identity verification, data sharing, and privacy protection, especially during significant transactions, accessing sensitive information, or executing legal documents.

**Where Should the Solution Be Used**

The solution can be used anywhere around the globe, particularly suitable for scenarios requiring cross-border verification or inter-institutional collaboration.
